Therefore, the proband\\'s  chromosome 4 was the unbalanced product of this insertional translocation from the  father resulting in partial monosomy 4q.

During our routine genotyping of affected individuals  and their relatives using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and  single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, we identified two families each  segregating three mutations. In both families, a mutation known to be associated  with 21-hydroxylase deficiency was identified in healthy individuals but was not  detected in the propositus. The propositus in family 1 was shown to be a homozygous  carrier for G at nucleotide 655, which alters the splice acceptor site at exon 3.  The propositus in family 2 carried the same splicing mutation on the maternal allele  and a gene deletion/conversion on the paternal allele. In both families, other  clinically unaffected relatives carried the Q318X mutation in exon 8. If molecular  diagnostic studies had been limited to the mutation carried by the propositi,  relatives would have been misinformed regarding their status as carriers or mildly  affected individuals.
